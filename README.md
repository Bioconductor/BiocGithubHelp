## Notes and tips for using github with Biocondcutor

Every bioc/fhcrc project (including this one, the githubCribsheet) is a separate repository (or 'repo') maintained under 

   https://github.com/Bioconductor
   
### To create your own project (aka repository) do these things:

 * Register as a user:  https://github.com/signup/free
 * Send an email to pshannon AT fhcrc.org so that I can give you permissions to create your repo under Bioconductor.
 * Go to https://github.com/Bioconductor.  Sign in.
 * Create your new repo by clicking on the leftmost of the three buttons you will find at the top right corner of the page. 
 It has a '+' on it.
 * This takes you to a new page where you will be asked to name your project
 * On this same page you can edit your repo's <b>README.md</b> which (like this file you are currently reading) records the central documentation for your project.
 * Save your changes to README.md:  a <i>Commit Changes</i> button is at the bottom right corner of the page.
