Notes and tips for using github with Biocondcutor

Every project (including this one, the githubCribsheet) is a separate repository or 'repo'.  It is maintained under 

   https://github.com/Bioconductor
   
To create your own project (aka repository) do these things:

 * Register as a user:  https://github.com/signup/free
 * Send an email to pshannon AT fhcrc.org so that I can give you permissions to create your repo under Bioconductor.
 * Go to https://github.com/Bioconductor.  Sign in
 * Create you repo by clicking on the leftmost of the three buttons you will find at the top right corner of the page. 
 It has a '+' on it.
